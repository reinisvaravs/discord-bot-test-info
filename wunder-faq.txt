Q: What is Wunder?
A: Wunder is an OnlyFans agency that helps creators grow their accounts through funnel optimization, content strategy, and a professional chatting team that handles subscriber engagement and sales.

Q: What are the steps to setting up a successful funnel?
A: The funnel includes creating a GetAllMyLinks page, building a clean Carrd landing page, linking it properly on Instagram, and ensuring OnlyFans profile and pricing are optimized.

Q: Why is GetAllMyLinks used over other tools?
A: GetAllMyLinks offers link cloaking, increasing conversion rates by redirecting fans to their default browser where they're already logged into OnlyFans.

Q: What subscription price should I use?
A: Set the subscription price to $15/month. Offer an 80% discount for new and expired subscribers to attract traffic and filter for potential big spenders.

Q: Why do we avoid using wishlists and multiple links?
A: More links = more exits from the funnel. Keeping one clean path improves conversion rates by keeping users focused on the intended action.

Q: What if someone messages me on Instagram?
A: Never engage with OnlyFans subscribers outside of OF. It hurts conversions and creates confusion. All chat should happen inside the platform.

Q: What kind of content should I post weekly?
A: You should create:
- 1 Sequence (with Tease, Warmup, Main, and Conclusion parts)
- 10 Individual Pictures (5 sexy, 5 lifestyle)
- 3 Long Form Videos
- 10 Short Form Videos
- 10 Voice Messages

Q: What is a content sequence?
A: A sequence is a 4-part content structure (Tease, Warmup, Main, Conclusion) used to build psychological buying momentum and increase total spend per subscriber.

Q: What conversion rate is considered good?
A: 2–3% is good. Above 3% is excellent. Below 2% usually means there's an issue with your funnel or content mix.

Q: What affects conversion rate the most?
A: Funnel clarity, content balance (sexy vs. classy), and traffic quality. U.S. traffic converts best.

Q: How should analytics be tracked?
A: Track GetAllMyLinks clicks + OnlyFans new subscribers daily. Then calculate the conversion rate: subscribers ÷ clicks.

Q: When do I get added to the chatting team?
A: When you've implemented content creation, the funnel, and are generating traffic. Chatting is enabled once you meet all 3 conditions.

Q: Can I message my subscribers myself after chatters take over?
A: No. Once the chatting team is in place, you must not interfere. They follow a proven framework and work full-time on engagement and upselling.

Q: Who creates the messages on OnlyFans?
A: The chatting team does, using psychological sales structures. Your job is to create great content and stay consistent.

Q: What if my conversion rate is low?
A: Reassess your funnel setup, content balance, and traffic source. Ask for help from the team and consider running 30-day A/B tests to improve.

Q: What should my Instagram profile look like?
A: Use a smiling, colorful profile picture. Your bio should be short and personal. Link only to your GetAllMyLinks. Don’t include wishlists or extra links — keep the funnel focused.

Q: What should my OnlyFans profile look like?
A: Use a clean, sexy profile picture (push-up bra or bikini). Banner should be lingerie or sexy lifestyle. Keep the page classy, not hardcore. Choose an attention-grabbing name like "TattedLoverxo".

Q: What tools should I avoid using?
A: Avoid Linktree, Wishlists, and tools like Milkshake. These reduce conversions. Only use GetAllMyLinks + Carrd for your link funnel.

Q: What should I do if I get stuck?
A: Reach out to the team via the “Community” page and ask questions. Also, rewatch the onboarding content and compare your funnel to the best examples shown.

Q: What makes a high-performing creator in this agency?
A: Someone who:
- Builds their funnel exactly as instructed
- Posts weekly content consistently
- Trusts the chatting team
- Avoids distractions and extra apps/tools
- Follows data, not feelings

Q: Do I have to post hardcore content to succeed?
A: No. In fact, staying sexy-but-classy improves long-term sales. Hardcore content can reduce perceived value and destroy psychological selling sequences.

Q: How long does it take to see results?
A: Most creators see traction within 30 days if they follow the setup 100%. Traffic quality and consistency matter most — not follower count.
